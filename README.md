# Neural-Network-With-One-Hidden-Layer
In this Project a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer is implemented. Using units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh(hyper-tan). Then computing the cross entropy loss followed by the forward and backward propagation used to update the parameter using the Gradient Descent Algorithm .
